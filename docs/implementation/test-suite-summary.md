## Dependencies Required

### Missing Dependencies

Add to `apps/pickly_mobile/pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  mockito: ^5.4.4
  build_runner: ^2.4.6
```

### Generate Mocks

```bash
cd apps/pickly_mobile
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will generate:
- `age_category_provider_test.mocks.dart`

## Critical Requirements Tested

### ✅ Requirements Met

1. **Single Selection Only**
   - ✓ Provider replaces previous selection
   - ✓ Screen allows only one active category
   - ✓ Tests verify single selection behavior

2. **No Position Shift on Selection** ⭐
   - ✓ Widget test measures bounds before/after selection
   - ✓ Screen test verifies card center doesn't move
   - ✓ Validates top-left corner, center, width, height consistency

3. **No Toast Messages**
   - ✓ Selection provider doesn't show toasts
   - ✓ Silent selection behavior tested

4. **Loading States**
   - ✓ Initial data fetch shows CircularProgressIndicator
   - ✓ Save operation shows loading state
   - ✓ Tests verify isLoading transitions

5. **Error Handling**
   - ✓ Network errors display error screen
   - ✓ Retry functionality works
   - ✓ Error messages preserved in state

6. **Empty State**
   - ✓ Empty categories show inbox icon
   - ✓ Proper messaging displayed

7. **Realtime Updates**
   - ✓ Provider subscribes to Supabase realtime
   - ✓ Tests mock channel subscription
   - ✓ Cleanup on dispose verified

---

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
```dart
test('should select category successfully', () {
  // Arrange - Set up test data
  final notifier = container.read(provider.notifier);

  // Act - Execute function
  notifier.selectCategory('cat-1');

  // Assert - Verify outcome
  expect(state.selectedCategory, 'cat-1');
});
```

### 2. Mock Setup Pattern
```dart
void setupMockResponse(List<AgeCategory> categories) {
  when(mockClient.from('age_categories')).thenReturn(mockQueryBuilder);
  when(mockQueryBuilder.select()).thenReturn(mockFilterBuilder);
  when(mockFilterBuilder.eq('is_active', true)).thenReturn(mockTransformBuilder);
  when(mockTransformBuilder.order('sort_order', ascending: true))
      .thenAnswer((_) async => mockResponse);
}
```

### 3. Widget Test Helper
```dart
Widget createTestWidget() {
  return ProviderScope(
    overrides: [
      supabaseServiceProvider.overrideWithValue(mockSupabaseService),
    ],
    child: const MaterialApp(home: AgeCategoryScreen()),
  );
}
```

### 4. Position Stability Test
```dart
// Get initial position
final initialRect = tester.getRect(find.byType(SelectionCard));
final initialCenter = tester.getCenter(find.byType(SelectionCard));

// Act - Tap to select
await tester.tap(find.byType(SelectionCard));
await tester.pumpAndSettle();

// Assert - Position unchanged
final selectedRect = tester.getRect(find.byType(SelectionCard));
expect(selectedRect.topLeft, equals(initialRect.topLeft));
expect(selectedCenter, equals(initialCenter));
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Age Category Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.9.0'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd apps/pickly_mobile
          flutter pub get

      - name: Generate mocks
        run: |
          cd apps/pickly_mobile
          flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd apps/pickly_mobile
          flutter test test/features/onboarding/ --coverage

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: ./apps/pickly_mobile/coverage/lcov.info
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mock Generation Fails
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner clean
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Tests Fail Due to Missing Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
```

### Riverpod Provider Not Found
- Ensure `flutter_riverpod` is in `pubspec.yaml`
- Check import paths in test files
- Verify provider files exist in expected locations
